# US Air Quality Data Analysis

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook code for exploratory data analysis of air quality in U.S. cities from 2000 - 2019. The data comes from the [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data).

This mini project includes using several python libraries for importing, merging and tidying data, answering questions about the data, as well as presenting charts to convey information.
